# Pathfinding

- This repo contains simple classes for graph implementation in python. Once the graph classes are in a working state, pathfinding algorithms will be written using the graph class.

## TO DO

- Unit testing for graph, node, and edge classes 

	- make tests for:
		- proper edge list return from interables (i. e. , edge value when expected vs tuple vs object)

- Pathfinding algorithms implemented, with possible test cases?
- visualizations that show the algorithms as they iterate over the graph
